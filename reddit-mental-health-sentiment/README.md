This project analyzes sentiment in mental health-related Reddit posts during the COVID-19 pandemic using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to quantify emotional tone across user posts from subreddits such as r/depression and r/anxiety and assess how sentiment may have shifted due to pandemic-related stressors
