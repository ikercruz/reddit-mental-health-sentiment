# Reddit Mental Health Sentiment Analysis During COVID-19

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and statistical modeling to analyze sentiment in Reddit mental health communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is structured using the Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS) framework for modularity, reproducibility, and clarity.

We evaluate whether Reddit posts express significantly negative sentiment, whether sentiment changed during the pandemic, and whether post characteristics like length can predict emotional tone. All code and visualizations are organized in a clear, scalable directory structure.
